This project targets Laravel 3 as a bundle, but you can use it on Laravel 4 too.
AutoCrud only supports MySQL at this time.


## Usage

In your controller:

```
$ac = new AutoCrud();
$ac->set_table('invoices');
return $ac->render();
```


## API

No documentation has been made yet. Use the source! :)
